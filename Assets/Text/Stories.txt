The streets are been unkind to you. You have several attempted assaults on you, one of which sends you to the hospital making you weary of strangers.

Trying to make things work you turn to petty crime, constantly lying to yourself and everyone around you, even to the harm of others. You are still haunted by the time where you framed an acquaintance for one of your crimes.

Saved from your loneliness by a friendly wild dog you tame. You are relatively content until you are framed by an acquaintance for a crime you did not commit. You come back from a short prison sentence to find your dog is gone.
