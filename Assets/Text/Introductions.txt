Running from an abusive stepmother, you float between friend's houses and homeless shelters.

After your parents perished in a car accident, you have had a hard time keeping a handle on life; constantly running and recklessly rejecting most forms of help. You wander the streets struggling to tread water.

When your mother suddenly went missing you had the unlucky draw of being sent to an abusive foster care. Being ill-prepared for life on your own, you are on your own when you finally break and run.
